ParticErl is a badly named efficient particle tracker written in Erlang.

Given a set of "frames" described by a series of particle points and reliabilities, it will produce a set of tracks. 

Advantages:
	The search grows linearly with the number of frames.
	Overly large search graphs are slowly pruned (least probably track first) until they become tractable.
	Automatic parallelisation. The code will automatically run in parallel on however many cores you have at your disposal. Further work should allow it to be run in a distributed manner across many machines.
